Node.js- Chat Template
===================

Am easily configurable Node.js Starter Template using ExpressJS, MongoDB / MongoJS, SocketIO, KnockoutJS and Bootstrap.

This is a basic chat app that provides all the functionality required by a typical website - serving static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images etc), database interactions, a persistent connection between server and browser (for real-time data transactions) and two way data binding between database and UI - but it can be easily configured to suit most typical website / web app needs. It's also responsive. There is little to no styling as it's meant to just provide a starting point to be built upon.

Follow the instructions to install <a href='https://mikedigitize.com/blog/nodejs-starting-template-part-1/'>here</a>. And then adapt it to however you see fit. Dead easy...
