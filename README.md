Node.js-Boilerplate
===================

A simple but effective Node.js Boilerplate using ExpressJS, MongoDB, SocketIO, jQuery, Bootstrap and AngularJS. This is a walkthrough in how to set it up quickly and get moving with the above. To show its use I'm going to set it up as a chat application - it may have been done before many times but it's a nice way of showing how to use the components and leaves a framework that is easily edited to perform all the typical functionality you need for a website.
